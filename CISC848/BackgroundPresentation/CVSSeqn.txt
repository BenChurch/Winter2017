3.2.1. Base Equation

The base equation is the foundation of CVSS scoring. The base equation (formula version 2.10) is:

BaseScore = round_to_1_decimal(((0.6*Impact)+(0.4*Exploitability)-1.5)*f(Impact))

Impact = 10.41*(1-(1-ConfImpact)*(1-IntegImpact)*(1-AvailImpact))

Exploitability = 20* AccessVector*AccessComplexity*Authentication

f(impact)= 0 if Impact=0, 1.176 otherwise

AccessVector     = case AccessVector of
                        requires local access: 0.395
                        adjacent network accessible: 0.646
                        network accessible: 1.0

AccessComplexity = case AccessComplexity of
                        high: 0.35
                        medium: 0.61
                        low: 0.71

Authentication   = case Authentication of
                        requires multiple instances of authentication: 0.45
                        requires single instance of authentication: 0.56
                        requires no authentication: 0.704

ConfImpact       = case ConfidentialityImpact of
                        none:             0.0
                        partial:          0.275
                        complete:         0.660

                        none:             0.0
                        partial:          0.275
                        complete:         0.660

AvailImpact      = case AvailabilityImpact of
                        none:             0.0
                        partial:          0.275
                        complete:         0.660

3.2.2. Temporal Equation

If employed, the temporal equation will combine the temporal metrics with the base score to produce a temporal score ranging from 0 to 10. Further, the temporal score will produce a temporal score no higher than the base score, and no greater than 33% lower than the base score. The temporal equation is:

TemporalScore = round_to_1_decimal(BaseScore*Exploitability
                *RemediationLevel*ReportConfidence)

Exploitability   = case Exploitability of
                        unproven:             0.85

                        not defined:          1.00

                        uncorroborated:       0.95

3.2.3. Environmental Equation

If employed, the environmental equation will combine the environmental metrics with the temporal score to produce an environmental score ranging from 0 to 10. Further, this equation will produce a score no higher than the temporal score. The environmental equation is:

EnvironmentalScore = round_to_1_decimal((AdjustedTemporal+
(10-AdjustedTemporal)*CollateralDamagePotential)*TargetDistribution)
